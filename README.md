<h4 font-style="italic">Realization rate: 81 %</h4>
<h4 font-style="italic">Final goal: 187 %</h4>

_____
<h3><b>Implemented:</b></h3>
- Model of control object (Power gain; DC Motor; Current sensor; Reductor; 
Rack and Pinion; Inverse Pendulum; Backward Acceleration converter; 
Hall sensor (Rotor speed and acceleration sensors));
- Model of MCU (High and Low level controllers; Control adapter);
- Model layout of ACS;
- Synthesis of Low level controller. 


<h3><b>Plan to realize:</b></h3>
- Synthesis of High level controller;
- Whole system test;
- Add non-linear elements in models;
- Research influence of interference on the system;
- Investigation of the possibility of setting an arbitrary pendulum position;

<h4>1. Graphics</h4>
Include .mldath files (graph) of system outputs before and after synthesis.
The following parameters are reflected in the file: 
- All outputs from inverted pendulum model (6 graph);
- Outpus from HallSensor (2 graph);
- Torque of DC Motor (1 graph);
- Feedback angular acceleration and velocity (2 graph).

<h4>2. Models</h4>
All developed models are located here

<h4>3. ResultTestMathModelingOfInversePendulum</h4>
Graphical results of the tests our inverted pendulum model.
The model was tested in isolation from control object and other model (only pendulum)

<h4>4. Tests</h4>
Test parameters for inverted pendulum
P.S.: Not our files; Conditions issued by laboratory assistans
